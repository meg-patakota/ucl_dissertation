Research Objective: Identifying Climate Change Mitigation Technologies using Cooperative Patent Classification system

We use patent data of 100,000 documents from Lens.org to perform this analysis with Natural Learning Processing techniques.

# Split of training, test and validation data

Each of the word_representation and CNN files consists of training and validation data.

The final/best model, i.e., CNN title+abstract includes the results for our test data.

TF-IDF: Consists of results for the SVM Model.

Doc2Vec: Consists of results for the SVM Model.

CNN Results: For each of the features and a combination of the features.

# Data

The testing dataset has been provided.

The training dataset could not be included due to the size of the file. This can be provided on request.
